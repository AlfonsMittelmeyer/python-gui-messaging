----------------------
**Now Mac compatible**

*The menu buttons - tkinter menu command items - were not visible for Mac. They are now located in the GUI - here (Linux) just below the menu*

Most gui builders offer only one kind of layout.
Most of them offer **place**.
SpecTcl offers **grid**.

But the DynTkInter GuiDesigner offers all:

 - **pack**
 - **place**
 - **grid**

And the DynTkInter GuiDesigner has the **most advanced grid layout**


A simple tkinter GUI
--------------------

Currently all the images in my github documentation have vanished, because I used an image hoster, who had deleted the images after some time. I also don't have local copies. So it will take some time, until I can make them anew.

There was interest for a workshop, how to program tkinter applications with help of the GuiDesigner and how to connect a created GUI with code for the logic. The DynTkInter GuiDesigner concept enables even beginners to programm complex GUI applications.

So here is the first chapter of the workshop: **Editing a simple Tkinter GUI**

It's about a calculator, which of course should work in the end.
